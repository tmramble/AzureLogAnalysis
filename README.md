# Portfolio Project: Azure Cybersecurity Simulation & Log Analysis

## Project Overview

This project simulates a cybersecurity scenario designed to test and analyze the security posture of virtual machines (VMs) in Microsoft Azure. The simulation involves creating and configuring VMs, performing multiple attack simulations (such as failed RDP, SQL, and SSH login attempts), and analyzing the resulting security logs from both an administrative and attacker's perspective. The goal is to learn how to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, monitor security logs, and understand system behavior under attack.

## Introduction

In this project, you will simulate a real-world cybersecurity scenario where both administrative and attacker roles are explored. Youâ€™ll configure Azure virtual machines, carry out different attack simulations, and then analyze the system's response through security logs. By the end of this project, you will have gained practical experience in detecting unauthorized activities, managing security events, and reviewing logs to identify potential threats.
